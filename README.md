# fire
Automatically create rom launchers for use with Steam on Linux

Fire takes filenames (for roms) as input, scrapes images (from thegamesdb) for said rom, and then creates .desktop files accordingly. These can be easily added to Steam.

Q: Why not use Ice? http://scottrice.github.io/Ice/
A: I couldn't get it to work on Linux, Python seems to dislike me. If you experience the same, feel free to try Fire.

Q: Why "Fire"?
A: I was too lazy to think of a better name and Fire was the first thing that came into my mind.

It's not the most polished piece of software and you'll probably need to change the sources if you want to adjust things to fit your needs. That aside, the solution works fine for me.
